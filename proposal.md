## Description and Motivation

The biggest motivation behind this project is showing potential employers what I am capable of. I want users to be able to see who I am and look at things I am working on.

## Prior Art

My core design is based off of past projects. After learning navbars and seeing a bunch of designs, it helped me narrow down whay I wanted my site to look like.

## Core User Workflows
- User knows who I am: The user should be able to see my name and read a little bit about me.
- User can see my work: The user should be able to see examples of my work.
- User should have a way to contact me: The user should be able to access my contact information.

## Tuesday-Thursday goals
- Tuesday: I should have most of my HTML done.
- Wednesday: I should have my Basic CSS done.
- Thursday: I should have my layout adjusted and finalized
